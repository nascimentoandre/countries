# REST Countries API

This is a React web app that was built using data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/). It shows information such as population, capital, currencies and languages of every country available in their database. This is a challenge proposed by [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

# What I used

I solved the challenge with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework, by using the new React hooks such as useContext, useState, useEffect, etc.

# Live version

A live version of this web application can be found [here](https://bcjl1.csb.app/).
